# Employee-Data-Analysis
This project demonstrates essential techniques using the **Pandas** library in Python.
It covers loadind dataset from an external file, data cleaning, data statistical summarization, data transformation, data aggregation, merging datasets, reshaping datasets.

## Key Features
- Loading a csv file into dataframe.
- Getting statistical summary using builtin pandas aggregation function.
- Performing data cleaning with some pandas functions.
- Transforming data.
- Merging datasets.
- Creating new columns from existing data (e.g., tax, net salary, salary level).
- Using __map()__ and __apply()__ with __lambda__ functions for column transformation.
- Summarizing data using __pivot_table()__.
- Reshaping data with __pivot()__ and __melt()__.
- Practical examples with staff salary and department data.
